create serverless VPC connector for Private IP based Cloud SQL

The lines you're referring to are part of a process to set up and deploy a Google Cloud Function that connects to a Cloud SQL instance using a private IP address. Let's break it down:

1. The `requirements.txt` file contains two Python libraries:
   ```
   pymysql
   sqlalchemy
   ```
   These are needed for the Cloud Function to connect to and interact with the MySQL database.

2. The `main.py` file contains the Cloud Function code:
   ```python
   import pymysql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   def sql_connect(request):
     engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://root:Welcome0@10.45.193.27/mysql',echo=True)
     tab = engine.execute('show tables;')
     return str([t[0] for t in tab])
   ```
   This function creates a SQLAlchemy engine to connect to a MySQL database at the private IP 10.45.193.27, executes a 'show tables' query, and returns the list of table names.

3. The Cloud Function is deployed using this command:
   ```
   gcloud beta functions deploy sql_connect --runtime python37 --project shailesh-1 --region asia-south1 --vpc-connector serverless-1 --trigger-http --service-account 664290125703-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
   ```
   This deploys the function named 'sql_connect' using Python 3.7 runtime, in the 'asia-south1' region, using a VPC connector named 'serverless-1' to allow private IP access, and sets it up with HTTP trigger.

4. The function is then tested using a curl command:
   ```
   curl -m 70 -X POST https://asia-south1-shailesh-1.cloudfunctions.net/sql_connect \
   -H "Authorization: bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{}'
   ```
   This sends a POST request to the deployed function URL, authenticating with a Google Cloud identity token.

5. The response shows a list of MySQL system tables, indicating that the function successfully connected to the database and executed the 'show tables' query.

This setup demonstrates how to connect a Cloud Function to a Cloud SQL instance using a private IP address, which is more secure than using a public IP. The VPC connector allows the function to access resources on the VPC network, including the privately addressed database.
