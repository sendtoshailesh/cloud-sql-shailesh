This sequence of commands demonstrates setting up and deploying a Google Cloud Function that connects to a PostgreSQL database using a Unix socket, which is typically used for connecting to Cloud SQL instances. Let's break it down:

1. `requirements.txt`:
   Contains the required Python libraries:
   - SQLAlchemy (version 1.3.12)
   - pg8000 (version 1.13.2) for PostgreSQL connectivity

2. `main.py`:
   Contains the Cloud Function code:
   ```python
   import pg8000
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   def psql_connect_public(request):
     engine = create_engine('postgresql+pg8000://postgres:Welcome0@/postgres?unix_sock=/cloudsql/shailesh-1:asia-south1:pg-db22/.s.PGSQL.5432',echo=True)
     tab = engine.execute('select tablename from pg_tables;')
     return str([t[0] for t in tab])
   ```
   This function connects to a PostgreSQL database using a Unix socket (`/cloudsql/shailesh-1:asia-south1:pg-db22/.s.PGSQL.5432`), which is the recommended way to connect to Cloud SQL from Cloud Functions. It then executes a query to list all tables and returns the result.

3. Deployment command:
   ```
   gcloud beta functions deploy psql_connect_public --runtime python37 --project shailesh-1 --region asia-south1 --trigger-http --service-account 664290125703-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
   ```
   This deploys the function named 'psql_connect_public' using Python 3.7 runtime in the asia-south1 region, sets it up with an HTTP trigger, and associates it with a specific service account.

4. Test command:
   ```
   curl -m 70 -X POST https://asia-south1-shailesh-1.cloudfunctions.net/psql_connect_public -H "Authorization: bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```
   This sends a POST request to the deployed function URL, authenticating with a Google Cloud identity token.

5. The response shows a list of PostgreSQL system tables, indicating that the function successfully connected to the database and executed the query.

The main difference between this setup and the previous one is the connection method. This function uses a Unix socket to connect to the Cloud SQL instance, which is the recommended method when both the Cloud Function and Cloud SQL instance are in the same project and region. This method doesn't require a VPC connector, as it uses Google's internal networking.

This approach is typically used when connecting to Cloud SQL instances with public IP addresses enabled, but it's actually connecting through Google's internal network, providing better security than connecting over public internet.
