This collection of commands and configurations demonstrates the process of setting up and managing replication from an external MySQL database to a Google Cloud SQL instance. Let's break down the key components:

1. User Creation and Permissions:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'myrep1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Welcome0';
   GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON *.* TO 'myrep1'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
   This creates a user for replication and grants necessary permissions.

2. External Source Configuration:
   JSON configuration for defining the external source database.

3. Cloud SQL Instance Creation:
   JSON configuration for creating a Cloud SQL instance as a replica.

4. API Calls:
   Using `curl` to make API calls to Google Cloud SQL Admin API for various operations like creating instances, verifying sync settings, and starting external sync.

5. GTID Configuration:
   Commands to enable GTID (Global Transaction Identifier) on the source database.

6. Data Export and Import:
   Using `mydumper` and `myloader` for data migration:
   ```
   mydumper -u root -p Welcome0 --threads=16 -o ./backup -h 10.0.4.25 --no-locks --regex '^(?!(mysql\.|sys\.))'
   myloader -u root -p Welcome0 --threads=16 -d ./backup -h 10.45.193.44 -o
   ```

7. Demoting Master:
   API call to demote a master instance to a replica.

8. Replication Setup:
   ```sql
   call mysql.setupExternalSource('10.0.4.25', 3306, 'myrep1', 'Welcome0', 'binlog.000006', 157, false, false);
   call mysql.startReplication();
   ```
   This sets up and starts replication from the external source.

9. Testing Replication:
   Inserting and updating data on the source to verify replication:
   ```sql
   insert into departments (dept_no,dept_name) values('d101','TestITver2');
   update departments set dept_name = 'IT-Tested-ver2' where dept_no = 'd101';
   ```

Key Points:
1. The process involves creating a replica instance in Cloud SQL, exporting data from the source, importing it to the replica, and then setting up replication.
2. GTID is enabled on the source for consistent replication.
3. API calls are used extensively for managing Cloud SQL instances and replication settings.
4. The process includes steps for both initial data sync and ongoing replication.
5. Proper permissions and network connectivity are crucial for successful replication.

This setup allows for migrating an external MySQL database to Google Cloud SQL while maintaining data consistency and enabling ongoing replication for disaster recovery or migration purposes.
