These commands demonstrate how to set up a secure tunnel to a Google Cloud SQL instance using Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) and the Cloud SQL Proxy. Let's break down each step:

1. Starting IAP Tunnel:
   ```
   gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel instance-mumbai 22 \
     --zone=asia-south1-c --local-host-port=localhost:4226
   ```
   This command creates a secure tunnel to port 22 (SSH) on the Compute Engine instance named "instance-mumbai" in the "asia-south1-c" zone. The tunnel is accessible locally on port 4226.

2. SSH Tunnel Configuration:
   ```
   ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 \
     -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine \
     -p 4226 localhost \
     -- /tmp/cloud_sql_proxy instances=shailesh-1:asia-south1:pg-db11=tcp:3306
   ```
   This command sets up an SSH tunnel that forwards local port 3306 to the Cloud SQL instance "pg-db11" through the IAP tunnel. It uses the Cloud SQL Proxy running on the Compute Engine instance.

3. Copying Cloud SQL Proxy to the Instance:
   ```
   gcloud compute scp ./cloud_sql_proxy instance-mumbai:/tmp
   ```
   This command copies the Cloud SQL Proxy executable from your local machine to the /tmp directory on the Compute Engine instance.

4. Running Cloud SQL Proxy on the Instance:
   ```
   /tmp/cloud_sql_proxy --instances=shailesh-1:asia-south1:pg-db11=tcp:3306
   ```
   This command runs the Cloud SQL Proxy on the Compute Engine instance, connecting to the specified Cloud SQL instance.

Key Points:
1. IAP Tunnel provides a secure way to access Compute Engine instances without exposing them to the public internet.
2. The SSH tunnel forwards the local port to the Cloud SQL instance through the Compute Engine instance.
3. Cloud SQL Proxy is used to establish a secure connection to the Cloud SQL instance.
4. This setup allows you to connect to your Cloud SQL instance as if it were running locally, even if it's not publicly accessible.

Use Case:
This configuration is particularly useful when you need to access a private Cloud SQL instance that doesn't have a public IP address. It provides a secure method to connect to your database for management, data migration, or application testing purposes.

Security Note:
Ensure that you handle the Google Compute Engine SSH key (~/.ssh/google_compute_engine) securely, as it provides access to your GCP resources.
